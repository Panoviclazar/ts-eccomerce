# React/Typescript E-commerce web-site

This is simple responsive web-shop, all styling and back-end logic is made with React. Products information is extracted from a JSON file called item.json in src/data folder. App mainly have inline css, but also some external css for hover and on click effects. All back-end logic code is in ShoppingCartContext file in src/context folder. For now web-shop doesnt have real checkout and payment method, only fake checkout with all products, total cost and form for costumer information and reload-page button. But as soon as I find time for the back-end work, I will finish the actual checkout and payment method.

Be free to try my web-shop and tell me your toughts, any suggestion, positive or negative, is welcome.
